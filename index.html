<img src="joeluke.jpg" alt="Me and Luke">
<p>My name is Joseph Luca.I come into this program with no experiece at all however, I'm quite ambitious to learn everything it takes to become a full
 stack developer.This program was refered to me by a friend who previously gradutated this bootcamp, and since I'm interested in coding 
I decided its time for a career change. I love the idea of being able to create something of my own from the ground up, and to be able to do that professionally is my end goal.
 I am 30 now and i finally found something i feel i can make of myself as a professional and i truly am intrested in this part of the tech world.
